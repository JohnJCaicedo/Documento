	abstract = {The research methodology consists of several stages to develop a noninvasive method of identifying the turgor of potato tubers during the storage. During the first stage, a graphic database (set of training data) has been created for selected varieties of potatoes. As a next step, special proprietary software called 'PID system' was used together with a commercial MATLAB package to extract parameters defining the digital image descriptors. This included: hue space models, shape coefficient and image texture. Thirdly, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training was conducted with the use of Statistica and MATLAB tools. As a result of the analysis, a neural model has been obtained, which had the greatest classification features.},

	abstract = {The majority of color histogram equalization methods do not yield uniform histogram in gray scale. After converting a color histogram equalized image into gray scale, the contrast of the converted image is worse than that of an 1-D gray scale histogram equalized image. We propose a novel 3-D color histogram equalization method that produces uniform distribution in gray scale histogram by defining a new cumulative probability density function in 3-D color space. Test results with natural and synthetic images are presented to compare and analyze various color histogram equalization algorithms based upon 3-D color histograms. We also present theoretical analysis for nonideal performance of existing methods. © 2011 IEEE.},
